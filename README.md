I'm fine with people reading my source code and learning from it. In fact, I learn best by reading through some code then cementing my understanding by implementing my own version of the code. But you'll never learn by blatantly copy-pasting another's code...so if there're people in the community who's fine with such an atrocity, it's best to at least encourage them to actively learn by not uploading a full source code here...

I've taken out the main part of the bot - the **BFS search**. Completing the code is easy enough once you get around implementing a BFS function. Looking back, my AI is really *really* simple...there's not that much aside from the BFS lol, rest is heuristic spaghetti which I left in for your consumption :D

A final word of warning...contest code is not gonna be pretty, **enter at your own risk.**
