Perhaps after I clean up my code and remove eval functions etc...

I'm fine with people reading my source code and learning from it. In fact, I learn best by reading through some code then cementing my understanding by implementing my own version of the code. But you'll never learn by blatantly copy-pasting another's code...so if there're people in the community who's fine with such an atrocity, it's best to at least encourage them to actively learn by not uploading a full source code here...
